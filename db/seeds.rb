			title:   "An Introduction To Acidity",
			summary: "Acidity is an important part of coffee, and weaves its way through the entire supply chain of the
					  industry from variety to picking, from process to roasting and from brewing to tasting. I want to start 
					  with the basics, cover some of the tasting aspect and then look at acids specific to coffee.
					  We tend to define acids as having a pH lower than 7, or as having a sour taste, but these aren’t 
					  particularly scientific. In fact there are three different scientific definitions of an acid: 
					  The Arrhenius definition, the Brønsted-Lowry definition and the Lewis definition.",
