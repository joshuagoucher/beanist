					  The film follows Mayra Orellana-Powell of green coffee importer Royal Coffee and Catracha Coffee 
					  Co., on a journey with several other coffee professionals from the Bay Area to Mayra’s hometown of Santa Elena, where she works to connect the 
                      farms to specialty coffee buyers and in turn helps improve the standard of living for farming families.",

			summary: "Acidity is an important part of coffee, and weaves its way through the entire supply chain of the
					  industry from variety to picking, from process to roasting and from brewing to tasting. I want to start 
					  with the basics, cover some of the tasting aspect and then look at acids specific to coffee.
					  We tend to define acids as having a pH lower than 7, or as having a sour taste, but these aren’t 
					  particularly scientific. In fact there are three different scientific definitions of an acid: 
					  The Arrhenius definition, the Brønsted-Lowry definition and the Lewis definition.",
